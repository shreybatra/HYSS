# HYSS

HYSS is an utility software in times of Small and Large scale Natural Disasters, that helps the people to send advanced SOS to the nearby help center (depending on the type of need) so that help and preventive meausures could be given as quickly as possible. Disasters come without notice and take many lives. We propose an efficient way for the government to tell us about some major disasters a little before they happen, that too as effectively and soon as they can. After the disaster occurs, it takes time for the relief center to reach the affected spot.

# Facilties
